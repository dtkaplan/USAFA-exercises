`r etude::exercise_title()` The graph shows a simplified model of the amount of usable wood that can be harvested from a typical tree in a managed forest of Ponderosa Pine. (You can see some actual forestry research models [here](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr292/1992_milner.pdf).)

```{r include=FALSE, context="setup"}
tree_volume <- makeFun(1000*pnorm(year, mean=15, sd=10)^3 ~ year)
```

```{r spider-tug-gloves-sandbox1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Sandbox for tree calculation", exercise.eval=FALSE, exercise.lines=8, exercise.completion=FALSE, exercise.startover=TRUE, exercise.diagnostics=TRUE}
slice_plot(tree_volume(year) ~ year, domain(year = c(0, 50))) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Usable wood product (board-feet)",
          x = "Year after planting")

```

You are writing a business plan for a proposed pine forest. Among other things, you have to forecast the revenue that will be generated and when you will have salable product.
