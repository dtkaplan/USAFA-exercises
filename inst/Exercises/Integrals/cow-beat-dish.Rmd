`r etude::exercise_title()` The graph below, from the New York *Times* on Feb. 21, 2012, shows three curves relating to H.I.V./AIDS prevalence and incidence over time.


```{r HIV-AIDS, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("images/HIV-AIDS-NYTimes.jpg", package="math141Zexercises"))
```

a. What is the relationship between the three curves?
b. The units on the $y$ axis are "millions of people."  That corresponds to the dimension of the top curve.  The two bottom curves have a different dimension.   What would be a sensible unit for the lower two curves?
c.  Use the appropriate calculus operations to show whether or not the graph represents the relationship between the three curves in a quantitatively correct manner.
